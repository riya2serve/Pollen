# Pollen

Pollen is a computational pipeline for analyzing long-read sequencing data of gametes. 
It integrates quality control, alignment, and downstream haplotype + crossover analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `LongQC/`(Fukasawa, Y. 2019)
   A tool for the data quality control of PacBio and ONT long reads. It has been vendored with local 
   modifications for read QC 

- `vendor/distortopia/src/`
   A tool for producing high-resolution mapping of meiotic crossovers & identifying segregation distorters. 

- `raw_data/` 
   Raw sequencing inputs (not tracked).

- `fastq/`
   Processed FASTQ files (not tracked). It also contains subsets of fastq data generated by the user for 
   testing downstream analyses. 

- `longqc_output/`
   Contains the report files (json and html summaries) produced by running the LongQC container. 
  
## Distortopia-demo integration

The Distortopia-demo scripts (within `src/`) have been vendored directly into this repository to ensure
a stable and reproducible analysis environment. 

To create the required conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f vendor/distortopia/src/environment.yml
conda activate disto 
```
